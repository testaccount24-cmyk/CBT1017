//***FILE1017 is from Steve Myers, and contains a batch utility     *   FILE1017
//*           to analyze the contents of load libraries in          *   FILE1017
//*           detail.  This analysis can be used to compare load    *   FILE1017
//*           libraries for changes, and to understand details      *   FILE1017
//*           about their general contents.                         *   FILE1017
//*                                                                 *   FILE1017
//*     email:  Steve Myers <mvsprog@yahoo.com>                     *   FILE1017
//*                                                                 *   FILE1017
//*     General Description:                                        *   FILE1017
//*                                                                 *   FILE1017
//*     The LMXREF utilities analyze load libraries and extract     *   FILE1017
//*     the IDR data in the load modules and reports this data.     *   FILE1017
//*     LMXREF is batch, not TSO.                                   *   FILE1017
//*                                                                 *   FILE1017
//*     At least in concept, the programs can analyze several       *   FILE1017
//*     libraries:  For example, a staging library for              *   FILE1017
//*     production programs and the production program library      *   FILE1017
//*     can be analyzed to verify the programs in the staging       *   FILE1017
//*     library reached the production library.                     *   FILE1017
//*                                                                 *   FILE1017
//*     The first program, LMXREF, analyzes a load library and      *   FILE1017
//*     creates a data set that is then processed by the LMXREFR    *   FILE1017
//*     utility.  Several LMXREF data sets can be processed by      *   FILE1017
//*     LMXREFR in a single run.                                    *   FILE1017
//*                                                                 *   FILE1017
